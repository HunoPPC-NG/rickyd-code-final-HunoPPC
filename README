RickyD - Another Rick Dangerous clone
=====================================

Introduction
------------

Rick Dangerous was one of my favorite games for the spectrum (and Amiga), 
it already has a very good clone (xrick), but it lacks the ability to easily
create new maps and enhance the graphics since they are built in the code itself.
RickyD uses xml extensively to configure all aspects of the game, from objects
to tiles and sound, maps are also written in xml, so they can be easily edited.
Creating completely new maps is very easy, just create a new tileset and use a 
tool like tiled to put everything together.

 
Dependencies
------------

RickyD uses the brand new SDL 2.0 and the matching libraries:
 SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer and SDL2_ttf.
 
You can get SDL 2.0 source packages from here: http://www.libsdl.org/hg.php

the libraries are also available through hg: http://hg.libsdl.org/



For Ubuntu Users:

 pre-built packages are available from my testing ppa:
	https://launchpad.net/~pj-assis/+archive/testing

For Windows Users:
 pre-built mingwin packages are available in the project Downloads section at sourceforge.


Building
--------

The recommended way:
 1 - install all dependencies
 2 - cd into the source root dir
 3 - Generate the configure script: ./bootstrap.sh
 4 - Clean up the source root dir: make distclean
 5 - Create the build dir: mkdir build
 6 - cd build
 7 - ./configure --prefix=/install/path
 8 - make && make install
 
 For mingwin users:
 
 the data path will be relative to the bin dir, so no use in setting
 a different data dir.
 For debugging in mingwin you should also set --enable-mingw-console
 this will enable console output.
 

Modding
-------

 The extensive use of xml, enables for easy modding of the game.
 global object attributes are stored in rick1_global.xml and
 each level file path is defined in levels.xml.
 for custom levels just add them accordingly in levels.xml.
 submaps can be created very easy with a tool like "Tiled"
 just add the tile layers (walls, stairs, platform, decor, ...), add the 
 tiles image and build your map, then export to lua and copy paste the layers
 array into a rickyD xml submap. Add the objects and you are done.
